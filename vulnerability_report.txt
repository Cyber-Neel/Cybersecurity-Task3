# Vulnerability Scan Report
Author: Neel Bhatt
Date: June 26, 2025

## Scan Details
- Tool: Nmap (fallback due to OpenVAS issues)
- Target: 127.0.0.1
- Date: June 26, 2025

## Identified Vulnerabilities
- No open ports or vulnerabilities detected (all 1000 ports closed).
- Possible limitation: Scan may not detect internal software vulnerabilities.

## Mitigations
- Maintain closed ports: Ensure firewall (e.g., `ufw`) remains active.
- Update software: Run `sudo apt upgrade -y` to address potential internal risks.

## Notes
- Attempted OpenVAS but failed to start `openvas-scanner.service`.
- Nmap scan showed no exposed services, possibly due to firewall.
